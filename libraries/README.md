- This module requires the third-party library GeShi 1.0.x (Generic Syntax
Highlighter, written by Nigel McNie) which can be found at
  http://qbnz.com/highlighter

- Download the GeSHi library from
https://sourceforge.net/projects/geshi/files/geshi/
Make sure you download a version of the branch 1.0.x and not a version
from the branch 1.1.x (also described as geshi-dev), which is not yet
supported by the GeSHi filter module.
Place the entire extracted 'geshi' folder (which contains geshi.php)
in this directory.
