GeSHi Filter
======================

The GeShi Filter is a Backdrop CMS module for syntax highlighting pieces of
source code. It implements a filter that formats and highlights the syntax of
source code between for example <code>...</code>.

<!-- All lines in this file should be no more than 80 characters long for
legibility, unless including a URL or example that requires the line not wrap.
(The above line starting with "Foo" is 79 characters for reference.)
Detail in READMEs should be limited to the minimum required for installation and
getting started. More detailed documentation should be moved to a GitHub wiki
page, for example, https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/setup/wiki/Documentation. -->

------------

This module requires the third-party library GeShi 1.0.x (Generic Syntax
Highlighter, written by Nigel McNie) which can be found at

USAGE
-----

```
The basic usage (with the default settings) is:
  <code language="java">
  for (int i; i<10; ++i) {
    dothisdothat(i);
  }
  </code>
When language tags are enabled (like "<java>" for Java) you can also do
  <java>
  for (int i; i<10; ++i) {
    dothisdothat(i);
  }
  </java>
```

More options and tricks can be found in the filter tips of the text format at
